## Setup / Going through the code

## Writing a Real Application v1

## v2 State + Time = ❤️

## Pulling in Data from other sources
- So now that we have a working program that can detect fraud, lets modify it so that we can pull in actual data sources. We will need to modify the FraudDetectionJob.java file to do this.
- We are going to want to change the DataStream<Transaction> lines to be DataSet<String>
